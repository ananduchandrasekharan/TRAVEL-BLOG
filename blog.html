  <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-file-pen"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;TRAVELLING TIPS</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
     <h2> 1. Your only job on the flight will be to kick back, relax, and enjoy the ride.</h2>
    <p>  If you're taking a suborbital flight, which is what companies like Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin are offering, your ride will be a quick up-and-down to reach space, rather than a full orbit of the Earth. While the journey will be short, it's going to be a relatively easy ride for you compared to what professional astronauts experience. For starters, you won't need to worry about flying your spacecraft. That's all up to the spaceflight provider. "You won't have any responsibility other than to enjoy the experience — and not kick anyone else in the head," says Dr. Parazynski. "Their obligations on the flight are pretty straightforward."
      
      So, other than learning to place your complete trust in your spaceflight provider, Parazynski recommends talking to people who have flown before in order to ease any nervousness. Dr. Chiao agrees: "The best advice I can give on launch — and it's easy to say, harder to do — is to try to relax and enjoy the whole process," he says. "Pay attention during your training, talk to other people who've been there if you can. And actually, you might be surprised — it's quite calm!"
    </p>
     
    <h2> 2. But you will want to make sure you’re physically and mentally fit.</h2>
  <p> "I think people should treat this as their Olympics or Super Bowl. This is a really big life experience, and though you don't need to be an Olympic athlete or a Super Bowl champion to fly in space, it helps to be fit," says Dr. Parazynski. After all, your body will be experiencing quite a range of new sensations during your spaceflight."
      
      But it's not just about physical fitness — mental fitness is key, too. "I think through fitness comes mental acuity as well," says Dr. Parazynski. "The more you can be engaged in the experience, the more you'll remember of it — it'll be more impactful to you."</li>
    </p>

   <h2> 3. The G-forces experienced on launch and reentry are not as intense as you might expect.</h2>
   <p> If you've ever watched a livestream of an astronaut launch, caught any Hollywood flick about space travel, or ridden Mission: Space at Walt Disney World's Epcot theme park, you know that during launch, astronauts get crushed back into their seats. (And, actually, during reentry, too!) They're experiencing strong G-forces, or a sensation of weight felt during acceleration. It's the same feeling you get when you speed up quickly in a car or zoom through a loop or a sharp curve on a roller coaster, but during a rocket launch, those forces are stronger and more sustained. While the experience might seem a little terrifying, the pros say it's quite manageable.
   
    "The G-forces aren't nearly as bad as they show in the movies," says Dr. Chiao. "If you're good enough to be given medical approval to go on a trip like this, you're not going to have any problems handling the G-forces." He also notes that you'll likely go through centrifugal runs during your training to prep for the sensation — you'll be strapped into a spinning machine that lets you experience strong G-forces, just like that spinning amusement park ride where you're pressed against the wall and the floor drops.
    
    But to make launch and reentry as comfortable on your body as possible, you'll want to physically relax your muscles so you don't fight against the G-forces. "If you relax and let your body sink into the launch couch, you're going to tolerate it much better," says Dr. Chiao. "If you're rigid, that's where you might hurt yourself. And make sure your limbs and arms are inside of the couch."
  </p>
    
  <h2>4. To prep for weightlessness, you should book a zero-G flight.</h2>
  <p>  While it takes quite a bit of effort (and time and money) to get into space to experience weightlessness, you can actually experience the sensation right here on Earth — or rather, just slightly above it. All you need to do is book a reduced-gravity flight, where a plane flies in a series of parabolas (or arch-like shapes) during which passengers experience simulated weightlessness through free fall.
    
    It's physically the same as skydiving or even riding a roller coaster, but in those two instances, your senses tell you you're actually falling. "When you're in a zero-G airplane, the airplane is falling at the same rate you are, so you're floating inside the airplane," says Dr. Chiao. "That's what it's like in a spacecraft when you get up into space and the engines cut off."
    
    Through commercial companies like the Zero Gravity Corporation, anyone who can spare the cost of a ticket can experience weightlessness — and anyone who's planning on making a trip to space should definitely give it a go. "If they have the means, they should get on a zero-G flight before they go on a suborbital flight," says Dr. Parazynski. "It would take some of the mystery out of 'what am I going to feel like?' and 'how do I move?'"
  </p>

  <h2>5. Learning how to scuba dive is good weightlessness training, too.</h2>
 <p> While being underwater isn't exactly like floating in space, it's a pretty good way to practice moving around in weightlessness. In fact, NASA even has a life-sized replica of the ISS set inside a giant pool, so that astronauts can train for spacewalks underwater.
  
  "Moving in weightlessness comes to you very quickly when you spend some time underwater," says Dr. Parazynski. "Get neutrally buoyant underwater and very gently try and move yourself along the ocean floor or bottom of your pool. It doesn't take a lot of force, but it does take a lot of thought."
</p> 
<h2> 6. Come up with a game plan for your few minutes in space.</h2>
<p>  On suborbital flights, you're only going to have a few minutes in weightlessness, so you should plan out exactly how you want to spend your time up there. Figure out if you'd like to bring a memento like a family photo or college pennant for a fun picture. (U.S. Naval Academy graduates and former astronauts Wally Schirra and Tom Stafford famously put a "Beat Army" sign in the window of their Gemini VI spacecraft, so there's a long tradition of this). Decide in advance if you want to attempt what spaceflight veterans call "stupid astronaut tricks," like flips or spins. But most importantly, budget time to look out the window.
  
  "The most important thing I would tell future astronauts is to savor the view out the window," says Dr. Parazynski. "It's, for lack of a better term, a God's-eye view, and so few people have ever had a chance to see it. It's really a beautiful thing to be hovering in space and looking down at your planet."
</p>
<h2>  7. Don’t worry about taking your own photos.</h2>
<p> "As far as taking photographs, I don't know that I would recommend it," says Dr. Chiao. "You're not going to be very good at it, first of all, because it takes a little bit of practice to get used to zero-G. Don't waste that time taking photos. Get your memories, look out those windows, and enjoy the whole experience of being weightless." Plus, given the price tag of these spaceflights, we're pretty sure that your operator will provide you with photos and videos of your journey anyway.
